<h2><b>What's the objective of this repository?</b></h2>

<h4>The project in question is an exercise for the "System Maintenance" course. It involves migrating 15 codes originally developed in C to Java. Throughout the process, we will make improvements as necessary, while staying closely aligned with the original proposal. The goal is to ensure that the programs maintain their core functionalities, while also leveraging the advantages and resources offered by the Java language.</h4>
